#textgenerator

You can store the sample txt in the file named "sample.txt".

Then run the code. But this text generator is not working perfectly.

It can only read one paragraph text and cannot adjust the length of the generated text.

For example, put the The Iraqi Constitution in the sample.txt and run the code, we will get:

In the most merciful, the land the sons of Adam. We have honored the first law made by man was passed, the most compassionate We have honored the homeland of Adam. We have honored the sons of writing and poets excelled.

Run it again,

we can get:

In the people of Adam. We have honored the people of numeration. Upon our soil, companions of the first law made by man was passed, the name of the people of the first law made by man was passed, the virtuous imams, pioneers of numeration. Upon our soil, companions of Adam. We have honored the most compassionate We are the most merciful, the most merciful, the virtuous imams, pioneers of writing and writers and prophets, abode of civilization, crafters of the most merciful, the first law made by man was inscribed, and upon our land the land the homeland of civilization, crafters of writing and prophets, abode of the Prophet and prophets, abode of the people of Adam. We are the virtuous imams, pioneers of numeration.

We are the people of the people of the most compassionate We have honored the virtuous imams, pioneers of civilization, crafters of the land between two rivers, the people of the most compassionate We have honored the sons of God, the most compassionate We are the land the most compassionate We are the most compassionate We have honored the name of the sons of the most compassionate We have honored the Prophet and scientists theorized and scientists theorized and cradle of Adam. We are the people of God, the homeland of Adam. We are the homeland of the Prophet and writers and saints prayed, philosophers and cradle of numeration. Upon our land between two rivers, the most ancient just pact for homelands policy was inscribed, and prophets, abode of writing and poets excelled.

We can tell from the result the backward word is choosen randomly after the forward word.

Basically, after the program scan all the text in the sample. It will remember which words have appeared after "the", just for example. Then while it's generating the text, it will choosen a word randomly from the words remebered in the forward step.

So we can get different results.
