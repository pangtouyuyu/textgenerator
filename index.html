    <section class="main-content">
      <p>You can store the sample txt in the file named "sample.txt".<p>
	 Then run the code.
	 But this text generator is not working perfectly.<p>
	 It can only read one paragraph text and cannot adjust the length of the generated text.<p>
	 For example, put the The Iraqi Constitution in the sample.txt and run the code, we will get:<p>
	 In the most merciful, the land the sons of Adam. We have honored the first law made by man was passed, <p>
	 the most compassionate We have honored the homeland of Adam. We have honored the sons of writing and <p>
	 poets excelled. <p>
	  <p><p>
	 Run it again, we can get:
	 In the people of Adam. We have honored the people of numeration. Upon our soil, companions of the first 
	    law made by man was passed, the name of the people of the first law made by man was passed, the virtuous imams, 
	    pioneers of numeration. Upon our soil, companions of Adam. We have honored the most compassionate We are the most 
	    merciful, the most merciful, the virtuous imams, pioneers of writing and writers and prophets, abode of 
	    civilization, crafters of the most merciful, the first law made by man was inscribed, and upon our land the land 
	    the homeland of civilization, crafters of writing and prophets, abode of the Prophet and prophets, abode of the 
	    people of Adam. We are the virtuous imams, pioneers of numeration. Upon our soil, companions of the Prophet and 
	    upon our land between two rivers, the most ancient just pact for homelands policy was passed, the apostles and 
	    writers and writers and writers and writers and upon our soil, companions of the land between two rivers, the 
	    most merciful, the virtuous imams, pioneers of the name of the virtuous imams, pioneers of the sons of civilization, 
	    crafters of numeration. Upon our soil, companions of the apostles and writers and saints prayed, philosophers and 
	    writers and writers and cradle of the apostles and prophets, abode of writing and scientists theorized and upon our
